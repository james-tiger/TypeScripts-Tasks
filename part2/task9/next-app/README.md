## Performance Measurement

The Next.js application provides several performance benefits:

1. Server-side rendering for faster initial page load
2. Automatic code splitting for optimal client-side navigation
3. Pre-rendering of pages for improved SEO
4. Optimized image loading and asset management

To measure the performance:

1. Build the application for production
2. Use the browser's DevTools Network tab to observe the loading behavior
3. Compare the metrics with the React application using client-side dynamic imports
